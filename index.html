                    I'm Allan Limo, a 23 year old, living in Nairobi. I'm currently a student at Moringa School pursuing a course in Software 
                    Development, perfecting my skills in Web development while specializing in full-stack development and user experience. My
                     interests extend beyond programming. When am not coding am probably hanging out with my friends and family, reading novels 
                     or tech articles while enjoying enjoy a good cup of coffee, watching good movies or nature documentaries.

                    Theres nothing more exiciting than finding a new idea or solutions, that would have a positive impact on people.
                     I've always been passionate about technology since i was in school hence choose to major in Software Engineering in college. 
                     A couple of years later its still what am most excited about and pursuing it as a carreer. Helping people and making a difference 
                     everyday is something i enjoy doing and this career allows me to do that. When i heard of Moringa School i knew it would be great 
                     opportunity for me to learn more and explore new concepts and ideas as in the tech world you can never learn enough.
